# Bitcoin Price Checker

I created a simple bash script to be run by Cron that checks the price of Bitcoin each hour during the work week (M-F 8-5). 

## Installation Instructions

```git clone https://github.com/taplummer/BTCPriceChecker.git```

```cd BTCPriceChecker```

```./installer```

Once you've run installer, there will be a new crontab job that runs Monday-Friday at each hour from 8 AM to 5 PM.

Happy HODLing!
